{"name":"Guard-phpunit","body":"Guard::PHPUnit\r\n==============\r\n\r\nPHPUnit guard allows to automatically & intelligently launch tests when files are modified.\r\n\r\nInstall\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to have [Ruby][1] running on your machine.\r\nThe latest versions of Ruby come with a packages-manager called Gem. Gem can be used to\r\ninstall various packages, including PHPUnit-guard.\r\n\r\nBefore you continue, also make sure you have the [Guard][2] gem installed\r\n\r\nTo install the PHPUnit-guard gem, run the following command in the terminal:\r\n\r\n    gem install guard-phpunit\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Guard usage documentation][3].\r\n\r\nGuardfile\r\n---------\r\n\r\nGuard::PHPUnit can be used with any kind of PHP projects that uses PHPUnit as\r\nits testing framwork. Please read the [Guard documentation][3] for more information\r\nabout the Guardfile DSL.\r\n\r\nBy default, Guard::PHPUnit will use the current working directory (pwd) to\r\nsearch for tests and run them on start (if you enabled the `:all_on_start` option).\r\n\r\n### Example PHP project\r\n\r\nThe [PHPUnit documentaion][4] uses the [Object Freezer][5] library as an example on how\r\nto organize tests. This project uses the `Tests` directory for its tests.\r\n\r\nAn example of the Guardfile for the same project would look\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nguard 'phpunit', :tests_path => 'Tests', :cli => '--colors' do\r\n  # Watch tests files\r\n  watch(%r{^.+Test\\.php$})\r\n\r\n  # Watch library files and run their tests\r\n  watch(%r{^Object/(.+)\\.php}) { |m| \"Tests/#{m[1]}Test.php\" }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptions\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe following options can be passed to Guard::PHPUnit:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n:all_on_start => false        # Run all tests on startup.\r\n                              # default: true\r\n\r\n:all_after_pass => false      # Run all tests after changed tests pass. This ensures\r\n                              # that the process of making changed tests pass didn't\r\n                              # break something else.\r\n                              # default: true\r\n\r\n:keep_failed => false         # Remember failed tests and keep running them with\r\n                              # each change until they pass.\r\n                              # default: true\r\n\r\n:tests_path => 'tests'        # Relative path to the tests directory. This path\r\n                              # is used when running all the tests.\r\n                              # default: the current working directory (pwd)\r\n\r\n:cli => '--colors'            # The options passed to the phpunit command\r\n                              # when running the tests.\r\n                              # default: nil\r\n```\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* Source hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/Maher4Ever/guard-phpunit)\r\n* Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Maher4Ever/guard-phpunit/issues)\r\n\r\nPull requests are very welcome!
